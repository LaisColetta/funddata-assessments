    "## What is Normal Distribution\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes the likelihood of obtaining the possible values that a random variable can take. Normal Distribution is one of the most basic probability distribution types. Also known as the Gaussian distribution, it is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical around the mean, with a bell-shaped curve. It also demonstrates that data close to the mean occurs more frequently than data far from it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Distribution is described by its mean (which is the average value of the data or <b>$\\mu$</b>) and standard deviation (which measures the spread of the data around the mean or <b>$\\sigma$</b>). As the standard deviation increases, the curve becomes flatter and more spread out, while a smaller standard deviation results in a taller, more narrow curve. The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x \\mid \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{ -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2 } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $f(x \\mid \\mu, \\sigma)$ represents the probability density at a particular value of $x$ given the mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. The term $\\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ is a normalizing constant that ensures that the area under the curve is equal to 1, and the term $e^{ -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\right)^2 }$ is the probability density at $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is often used to model real-valued random variables because it has several properties, it has applications in many fields, including finance, biology, and engineering. For example, it is often used to model the distribution of financial returns, the distribution of heights in a population, and the distribution of errors in measurements. Because normally distributed variables are so common, many statistical tests are designed for normally distributed populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the properties of normal distributions means you can use infer statistical numbers to compare different groups and make estimates about populations using samples such as discussed in our numpy.random modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuous vs. Discrete distribution\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of probability distributions: continuous and discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "A continuous probability distribution is a distribution that is defined over a continuous range of values, such as all possible values on the real number line. Continuous distributions are often used to model phenomena that can take on any value within a certain range, such as the height of a person or the time it takes for a chemical reaction to occur. Examples of continuous probability distributions include the normal distribution, the uniform distribution, and the exponential distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete probability distribution is a distribution that is defined over a set of discrete values, such as integers or categories. Discrete distributions are often used to model phenomena that can only take on a limited set of values, such as the number of heads that result from flipping a coin or the number of defects in a manufactured product. Examples of discrete probability distributions include the binomial distribution, the Poisson distribution, and the geometric distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that probability distributions can be either continuous or discrete, depending on the nature of the random event being modeled. For example, the height of a person is a continuous variable, so a continuous probability distribution would be used to model the distribution of heights in a population. On the other hand, the number of heads that result from flipping a coin is a discrete variable, so a discrete probability distribution would be used to model the probability of different numbers of heads occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a graph taken from the website [databasetown.com](https://databasetown.com/types-probability-distribution-characteristics-examples/) which shows the difference between concrete and discrete and examples of types of distributions:\n",

    "## Standard Normal Distribution\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is also known as the <b>\"z-distribution\" </b>because it is often used to standardize data by converting it to \"z-scores.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a value is away from the mean. For example, a z-score of 1 indicates that a value is one standard deviation above the mean, while a z-score of -2 indicates that a value is two standard deviations below the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard normal distribution is a useful reference distribution because it allows you to compare data from different distributions on the same scale. For example, if you have data from two different populations with different means and standard deviations, you can convert the data to z-scores using the mean and standard deviation of each population, and then compare the data on the same scale.\n",

Using the article 'Normal Distribution' published in the website link [National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3915399/#:~:text=Sample%20size%20has%20a%20significant,result%20in%20a%20normal%20curve) written by Jogikalmat Krithikadatta, we will explain this correlation in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the author, <i>\"Sample size has a significant effect on sample distribution. It is often observed that small sample size results in non-normal distribution. This is a result of inadequate estimation of the dispersion of the data, and the frequency distribution does not result in a normal curve</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, the larger the sample size, the more accurate and precise the estimates derived from the sample will be. This is because a larger sample size allows for a more representative and comprehensive representation of the underlying population, which in turn leads to more stable and reliable estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, smaller sample sizes may result in less accurate and less precise estimates, as they may not adequately capture the true characteristics of the population. This can be particularly problematic when the underlying population is not normally distributed, as the assumptions of normality may not hold for smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appropriate sample size for a given study will depend on a variety of factors, including the size of the underlying population, the level of precision desired, and the resources available for collecting and analyzing the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a tendency to assume that the normalcy would be better with very large sample size. However, it is observed by the author that the data shows normal distribution at n = 30 (1e) and the distribution remains the same when the sample size is 120 (1f). \n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the mean and standard deviation for different sample sizes, it can be noted that the mean varies from 35 to 32 MPa between n = 10 and n = 25, but stabilizes at 33.3 MPa when n = 30. However, the standard deviation is gradually decreasing from 7.57 to 5.04 with an increase in sample size. Hence the shape of the normal distribution is a function of SD.

Observational can be done easily by plotting a histogram and observing a few characteristics.

    "## Normality tests\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "When analysing a dataset, there are several ways to determine whether the data is normally distributed, or approximately normally distributed. According to the article [How to Test for Normality in Python](https://www.statology.org/normality-test-python/) common methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual inspection: One simple way to check for normality is to plot the data using a histogram or a normal quantile plot. A histogram is a graph that shows the frequency distribution of a set of data, and a normal quantile plot is a graph that compares the data to a theoretical normal distribution. If the data are approximately normally distributed, the histogram or normal quantile plot should roughly follow a bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistical tests: There are also several statistical tests that can be used to formally test whether a dataset is normally distributed. Some commonly used tests include the Anderson-Darling test, the Shapiro-Wilk test, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These tests compare the data to a theoretical normal distribution and provide a measure of how well the data fit the normal curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep in mind that no single method is foolproof, and it may be necessary to use a combination of methods to determine whether a dataset is approximately normally distributed. In addition, it is important to recognize that normality is not always a necessary assumption for statistical analysis, and other types of distributions may be just as appropriate for certain types of data and research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anderson-Darling test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anderson-Darling test is a statistical test used to determine whether a sample of data is drawn from a population that follows a particular distribution, such as the normal distribution. It is based on the Anderson-Darling statistic, which measures the distance between the observed data and the expected values under the specified distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the Anderson-Darling test, we first calculate the Anderson-Darling statistic for the sample. This is done by comparing the sample data to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the assumed distribution, and then summing the resulting squared differences. "

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution is a type of probability distribution that is symmetrical around the mean, with a bell-shaped curve. It is also known as a Gaussian distribution. In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal, and the distribution has a uniform shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key properties of a normal distribution is that about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and about 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. This property is known as the 68-95-99.7 rule or the empirical rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that not all data follows a normal distribution, and it is important to check the distribution of your data before assuming it is normally distributed and using statistical tests that assume a normal distribution."
