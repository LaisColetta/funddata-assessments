# Fundamentals of Data Analytics

#### Student Lais Coletta Pereira


## Introduction

This repository contains all the assignments and final assessment for the Fundamental of Data Analytics module part of Data Analytics course from the ATU University. 

## Jupyter Notebook 

All the files in this repository were made using Jupyter notebook, developed using python language and VS Code to edit and upload the code to github.com. In order to open this repository you will need to have Jupyter installed. You can find the installation documentation for the [Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html). The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can install Jupyter using  [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), which is the package manager for Python.

```
pip install jupyter
```

Once you have installed Jupyter, you can start the notebook server by running the following command in your terminal:

```
Jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Jupyter dashboard, which will show the files and directories in the current directory. You can then navigate to the directory where you have saved your notebook file, and click on the notebook file to open it. The notebook will be displayed in a new tab in your web browser.

In order to run this repository locally you will need to clone this repository.

To clone this repository using the command line, you will need to have Git installed on your system. You can check if Git is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```
git --version
```

If Git is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions for your operating system from the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once you have Git installed, you can clone a repository using the git clone command followed by the URL of the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:LaisColetta/funddata-assessments.git
```

This will create a new directory called repository, and download the contents of the repository into that directory. The directory name is created based on the name of the repository you are cloning.


## About this repository

In this repository there is a folder called practicals, a gitignore (personalised for macos), the folder 'Datasets' (that contains the dataset used in the exercises) and a Jupyter Notebook called Normal Distribution. The practicals folder contains the assignments for each topic discussed in this module, the topics were: 

 * Topic 1: Information
 * Topic 2: Randomness
 * Topic 3: Bias
 * Topic 4: Outlier
 * Topic 5: Cleasing

At the end of each section of the topicts, our lecturer gave us an exercise to practice what we have learned.

The jupyter notebook called Normal Distribution was the final assessment in which we had the freedom to discuss what we found essencial about this theme. The hypothetical public we aimed to reach with this assessment would be other students that already have some knowledge about probability and the topics we have discussed in the course of this module. What I chose to cover in my notebook was a brief introduction about Normal Distribution including topics such as Continuous and Discrete distribution, Bell-Curve and the empirical rule. Aftern, I discussed about the importance of identifying the skewerness of the graph in machine learning, some common Normality tests to identify if a dataset is normally distributed and then I brought a real-life example of s Normal Distribution.

All the references I used for this project are mentioned throughout the project but also listed at the end of the jupyter notebook.
