Outliers - Exercise 1
Recreating a Wikipedia Box Plot
Introduction
The purpose of this exercise is recreate the following Wikipedia Box Plot by producing multiple box plots from a dataframe on the one plot
Create box plots on a single set of axes for all five experiments in the morley data set.

Exercise 2
Create box plots for all of the numercial variables in Fisher's Iris Data Set.

Exercise 3
Adapt the above code and plots so that the overall plot is inversely propertional and the individual groups are directly proportional.
# Same plot as above but with best fit lines included

# Refer to Simpson's Paradox
